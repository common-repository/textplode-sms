Textplode has been designed to be simple and easy to use, and we've now applied the same concept to this WooCommerce module.

== Description ==

Our extension is completely free to download and integrates SMS features into your WooCommerce store. You can create custom templates that you're able to assign to different order statuses so that when you change the status of an order, the customer is sent a text message to notify them.

You can configure this module to send you a text when a new order is placed on your store, or when a new customer registers. You're even be able to merge your WooCommerce customers to a group on the Textplode platform and send marketing messages to your customers in one go. There's loads of more features available from within the Textplode platform - to find out more, [click here](https://www.textplode.com/features).

This extension uses the Textplode API and you'll need to create an account to use this module. Registration takes seconds, is completely free and you'll receive 10 free credits if you verify your account. You only pay for the messages you send and can purchase credits from within your Textplode account. Any undelivered messages sent to UK phone numbers are refunded.

We use a Tier 1 supplier for our text messaging, so delivery is guaranteed and instant. Beware of companies selling text messages at a lower rate as they will be simply reselling for someone else or using poor routes and your messages will hardly ever reach your customers phones or will arrive hours later.
